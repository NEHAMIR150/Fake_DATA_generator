# Fake_DATA_generator
The Fake Data Generator is a web-based application designed to generate realistic, structured fake data for software testing and test case automation. It helps QA engineers, testers, and developers quickly create large datasets for UI controls such as textboxes, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and unknown inputs—without using real user data.
